* ```source /opt/toolchains/dc/kos/environ.sh```
* ```make -f Makefile.dreamcast clean```
* ```make -f Makefile.dreamcast```
* ```mkdcdisc -e '/PATH-TO/mudclient.elf' -d '/PATH-TO/cache' -o RuneScape.cdi -N```

## Build Instructions (linux):

install [libsdl2-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsdl2-dev).
if compiling with opengl support, also install
[libsdl2-image-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsdl2-image-dev),
[libglew-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libglew-dev),
[libgl-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libgl-dev),

    $ make
    $ ./mudclient

distribute with `./cache` directory.


## Credits
* @Bruceleeto for the initial porting attempt, helping me get started with a makefile, as well as a few pointers I probably should have figured out by reading the documentation
* The Simulant.dev and OpenRSC Discord Servers
