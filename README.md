# RuneCast -- An RSC-C Port to the SEGA Dreamcast, SGI IRIX Workstations, and other Legacy Hardware!

portable, enhanced runescape classic client ported to C99. supports 204 and 177
protocols. original mudclient204 java source refactored by v0rtex/xetr0v and
Isaac Eggsampler. compatible with [rscsundae](https://git.sr.ht/~stormy/rscsundae),
[openrsc](https://rsc.vet/) and 2003scape.

### Prominent new features include:
* Native port for Sega Dreamcast!
* Modular build options! (WIP)
* Keyboard and Mouse Support!
* It doesn't run on stock hardware (yet)!
* [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/S82mFwhhEy)

### Run Requirements

* A Sega Dreamcast, or Dreamcast Emulator, such as Flycast, Devcast, or Deecy

* [A Computer with the KallistiOS build environment installed](https://dreamcast.wiki/Getting_Started_with_Dreamcast_development)

### Controls (Dreamcast):

* Maple Keyboard and Mouse

* OR (soon)

* Sega Dreamcast Controller:
* D-Pad/R Analog (if available) to control camera
* L analog for mouse input
* Start - ??? (Probably on-screen keyboard)
* A/B - Mouse button 1 and 2
* X/Y - Middle Mouse-Click

## Build Instructions (Dreamcast):

[Requires KallistiOS set up to build](https://dreamcast.wiki/Getting_Started_with_Dreamcast_development). When that is installed, cd to the RuneCast folder in your Terminal and type the following:
 
* 1.`source /opt/toolchains/dc/kos/environ.sh` To build with the Dreamcast Toolchain
* 2.`make -f Makefile.dreamcast [SDL-VERSION-OF-CHOICE] clean` Clean your build environment

* This part of the process has you choose between building with SDL1.2 (Please use @GPF 's SDL1.2, not the one built into KallistiOS), or SDL2. Instructions on building SDL2 are below these instructions

* 3a.`make -f Makefile.dreamcast SDL12=1` if building with SDL1.2 (Recommended for now)
* 3b (Optional).`make -f Makefile.dreamcast SDL2=1` if building with SDL2 (Unfinished)

* If you want to build with GLdc (Currently unimplemented, don't bother trying just yet):
* 3c (Optional). `make -f Makefile.dreamcast [SDL-VERSION-OF-CHOICE] GLDC=1`

* Also, If you have mkdcdisc installed, symlinked to /usr/local/bin, and want to build the game and make a CDI right away, with a single command, you can do this...
* 3d.`make -f Makefile.dreamcast [BUILD_OPTIONS] CDI=1`
* ...else, if you built without CDI=1, and only have an .elf...
* 4.`mkdcdisc -e mudclient.elf -d './cache' -o RuneScape.cdi -N` 
* ...you can build the CDI yourself with that command.
* 5(optional).`flycast RuneScape.cdi` 
* For instant testing, if you have flycast set up to run as a command by symlinking to /usr/local/bin. Other emulators may do this, I'm not sure.

## (Optional) Build Instructions (Dreamcast-SDL2):

* This is for the DC SDL2 library itself. Refer to the instructions above to actually build the game with SDL2. As SDL1.2 comes with KallistiOS as a KOS-Port, there is no need to do this for that version. As SDL2 is available as a KOS-Addon external to KallistiOS. I've included it, and build instructions, in this package, [but you should check the original repo for updates.](https://github.com/GPF/SDL2) Dreamcast SDL2 is under continuous development, and implementation is currently experimental in this project. I do not update the SDL2 that I've included in this project, and implore you to track the progress of its development, and periodically update/rebuild it as it continues.

* 1. ```source /opt/toolchains/dc/kos/environ.sh``` To build with the Dreamcast Toolchain
* 2. ```cd [PATH-TO-RUNECAST-DIRECTORY]/SDL2-dreamcastSDL2/build-scripts``` change directory to the 'build-scripts' folder
* 3. ```./dreamcast.sh``` 'Run the Dreamcast SDL2 build script.' This will automatically install the library to the addons folder in your DC toolchain.

### "Gee, Billy! How come your mom lets you have TWO SDLs?"
 I think it's useful to have the ability to pick and choose the libraries you want to use for the games you're building. I'm still learning how to port games, so having both options will not only allow me to benchmark performance, but also possibly help me find problems with the game itself. If there are other libraries I use that have "competition" (Like GLdc and KallistiGL), then I will also try to incorporate both of them as build options. Not many Dreamcast games have this option, and I think it's a good idea to get real-world performance to benchmark the libraries that we use, so that everything can be improved.

## Build Instructions (linux):

install [libsdl2-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsdl2-dev).
if compiling with opengl support, also install
[libsdl2-image-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsdl2-image-dev),
[libglew-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libglew-dev),
[libgl-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libgl-dev),
and [pkgconf](https://packages.debian.org/sid/pkgconf).

    $ make
    $ ./mudclient

distribute with `./cache` directory.


## Credits
* @Bruceleeto for the initial porting attempt, helping me get started with a makefile, as well as a few pointers I probably should have figured out by reading the documentation.
* Frogdoubler for answering my questions with an insane level of detail.
* The Simulant.dev and OpenRSC Discord Servers.
* @GPF/GPFTroy for his SDL1.2, SDL2, and SDL3 Port to Dreamcast, and advice.
